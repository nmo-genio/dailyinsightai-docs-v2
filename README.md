# 📘 DailyInsightAI Docs — Attempt 2

This is my second attempt at creating a documentation site for the DailyInsightAI project.

The goal: build a **clean, crisp-looking** documentation experience using modern tools.

## 🚀 Project Description

This repo contains the structure and content for a documentation site built with **Nextra**, a Next.js-based static site generator.

- ✍️ Focus: Simplicity and clear navigation
- 🎯 Purpose: Document the development journey and features of the [DailyInsightAI](https://github.com/nmo-genio/dailyinsightai) app
- 🎨 Look: Crisp, minimalistic — still a work in progress
- ⚠️ Challenges: Hard to customize, and managing dependencies can feel like a bit of a nightmare

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)
- **Language**: Markdown / MDX

## 🚀 Deployment

To build and deploy the documentation site locally or to a platform like Vercel:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# (Optional) Start a local server to preview the build
npm run start
```

> 📝 For production, connect this repo to Vercel or your preferred hosting provider and enable automatic deployments from the `main` branch.
